# red/gtk for macOS using docker or vagrant

N.B.: this project is an updated version of `docker-red-gtk` only dedicated to macOS/Catalina user willing to use `red/red:GTK` since 32bits binary is no more considered with this version of macOS.

## Requirement 

Please, before installing, check that these tools are not yet installed

```{bash}
brew cask install docker # updates are then automatically managed 
brew cask install xquartz
brew install socat
```

```
if [ -f "<path-docker-red-init-sh>/docker-red-init.sh" ];then . <path-docker-red-init-sh>/docker-red-init.sh; fi
```
1. socat service: to connect DISPLAY inside the container to XQuartz:
	* start socat: `docker-red service start`
	* stop socat: `docker-red service stop`
1. Build docker image(s): `docker-red  build `
